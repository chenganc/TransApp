To access the site, navigate to the main_project folder and run "vagrant up".
Go to localhost:8080 in your browser after seeing 'execute[unicorn server start] action run' in the terminal.

Known issue: Vagrant up with Nginx is working with OSX (tested on two Macbook pros on macOS, Sierra) but is not working on Windows. After some research, we suspect that unicorn is not compatible with Windows.
